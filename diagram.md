Create a clear, professional diagram showing how event study timing differs between person-year and district-year panels in education research.



The diagram should show:



TOP SECTION - "Person-Year Panel (Jackson et al.)"

- Title: "District X in Year 2000 (Reform Year = 1990)"

- Two side-by-side timelines for two students in the same district:

  

  LEFT: "Student A (Born 1983)"

  - Timeline from 1988 to 2000

  - Mark 1990 with a star labeled "REFORM (age 7)"

  - Mark 2000 with a circle labeled "Age 17 - OBSERVED"

  - Show "Event Time = +10" prominently

  - Shade the post-1990 period to show "10 years post-reform exposure"

  

  RIGHT: "Student B (Born 1978)"

  - Timeline from 1983 to 2000

  - Mark 1990 with a star labeled "REFORM (age 12)"

  - Mark 1995 with a circle labeled "Age 17"

  - Mark 2000 with a square labeled "Age 22 - OBSERVED"

  - Show "Event Time = +5" prominently

  - Shade the post-1990 period to show "5 years post-reform exposure"



CALLOUT BOX between the two timelines:

"Same district, same year → DIFFERENT event times

This creates within-district-year variation!"



BOTTOM SECTION - "District-Year Panel (Replication)"

- Title: "District X in Year 2000 (Reform Year = 1990)"

- Single timeline from 1985 to 2000

- Mark 1990 with a star labeled "REFORM"

- Mark 2000 with a circle labeled "OBSERVED"

- Show "Event Time = +10" prominently

- Shade the post-1990 period



CALLOUT BOX:

"One observation per district-year → ONE event time

No within-district-year variation"



Use a clean, academic style with:

- Blue color scheme

- Clear labels and arrows

- Professional fonts

- Sufficient whitespace

- Legend explaining symbols (star = reform, circle = observation)
